This repository is a catchall for various loose classes from M Cubed apps that don't really fit in a framework. They don't contain tests and have patchy documentation. The code has also not been cleaned up. As such you should be a bit more careful if you use them in your apps.

All source code in this repository is covered by the MIT licence (found in LICENSE.txt).
